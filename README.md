**Simplified Git Workflow with Commands**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    
    ```
    
    This command creates a local copy of the remote repository on your machine. Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.
    
2.  **Create a Feature Branch:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b feature/<feature_name>
    
    ```
    
    First, switch to the `develop` branch. Then, create a new branch for your feature. Replace `<feature_name>` with a descriptive name for your feature (e.g., `user-authentication`, `product-catalog`).
    
3.  **Make Changes and Stage Them:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    # Make changes to your code ...
    
    git add <file1> <file2> ...
    
    ```
    
    Make the necessary code changes for your feature. Then, use `git add` to stage the files you've modified.
    
4.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
    
    ```
    
    Commit your changes with a clear and concise message explaining what you've done.
    
5.  **Push Your Branch:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git push origin feature/<feature_name>
    
    ```
    
    Push your feature branch to the remote repository.
    
6.  **Create a Pull Request:**
    
    -   Go to your Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    -   Create a new pull request from your feature branch to the `develop` branch.
    -   Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.
    -   Request a review from your team members.
7.  **Address Code Review Feedback:**
    
    -   If your reviewers have suggestions, make the necessary changes in your feature branch.
    -   Commit and push the updated code to your branch.
8.  **Merge Your Pull Request:**
    
    -   Once your pull request is approved, merge it into the `develop` branch.

**Additional Commands**

-   **Fetch the Latest Changes:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git fetch origin
    
    ```
    
    This command retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branches.
    
-   **Pull Changes from the Remote Branch:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git pull origin develop
    
    ```
    
    This command fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote `develop` branch into your current local branch.
    
-   **Switch Between Branches:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git checkout <branch_name>
    
    ```
